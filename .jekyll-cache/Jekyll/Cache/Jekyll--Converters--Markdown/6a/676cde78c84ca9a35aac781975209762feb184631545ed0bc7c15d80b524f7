<h2 id="privacy-aware-sparse-architectures-for-control-and-estimation">Privacy Aware Sparse Architectures for Control and Estimation</h2>

<p>We are interested in determining sparse architectures for control and estimation for large-scale dynamical systems in this work. The emphasis is on understanding the tradeoff between utility and privacy in these problems. The utility is defined as accuracy or performance that is below a user-defined bound. Whereas privacy is defined as accuracy or performance that is above a user-defined bound. These problems are considered in the Kalman filtering framework, including ensemble and unscented variants, and \(\mathcal{H}_2\) and \(\mathcal{H}_\infty\) framework. NSF and AFOSR are funding the work.</p>

<h2 id="information-fusion-on-manifolds">Information Fusion on Manifolds</h2>

<p>Space situational awareness is concerned with tracking space objects and classifying them with respect to specific characteristics. In this research, we are developing novel algorithms for uncertainty propagation and state estimation. Challenges include non-Gaussian uncertainty supported on cylindrical coordinate systems \(\mathbb{R}^5\times\mathbb{S}\), sparse sensing, and unknown sensor characteristics. These algorithms are used for conjunction analysis, which predicts upcoming object encounters to notify satellite operators and avoid high-risk encounters. AFOSR and Intelligent Fusion Technology are funding this work.</p>

<h2 id="asynchronous-numerical-algorithms">Asynchronous Numerical Algorithms</h2>

<p>Future exascale machines are expected to have \(10^5-10^6\) processors, providing a deep hierarchy of systems and resources. However, many challenges exist, which must be overcome before exascale systems can be utilized as a useful tool to further understanding critical scientific inquires. Among the main obstacles to scaling code to exascale levels is the communication necessary in tightly coupled problems, such as in <strong>uncertainty propagation, turbulence flow simulations at high Reynolds numbers, and large-scale convex optimization</strong>. The synchronization across processors can cause 50-80% processor idle time. Our research focuses on asynchronous numerical algorithms that do not wait for data to be synchronized. Communication between processors is modeled as a stochastic channel, and the behavior of the numerical algorithm is analyzed in a stochastic jump dynamical system framework. NSF has funded this work.</p>

<h2 id="uncertainty-management-in-cyber-physical-systems">Uncertainty Management in Cyber Physical Systems</h2>

<p>Cyber-physical systems have strong coupling between physics, communication, and computation. In our research, we develop algorithms for quantifying uncertainty in system behavior due to uncertainties in the physics (unmodeled dynamics, process and sensor noise), communication (irregular channels, packet loss, etc.), computation (jitter in real-time tasks, CPU transients, etc.). The system-level behavior is modeled as a stochastic jump system, and new uncertainty propagation algorithms for such jump systems are developed. New stochastic scheduling algorithms have been developed that switch between computational tasks to ensure system-level robustness. NSF has funded this work.</p>

<h2 id="modeling--control-of-tensegrity-systems">Modeling &amp; Control of Tensegrity Systems</h2>
<p>A tensegrity system is an arrangement of axially-loaded elements (no element bends, even though the overall structure bends) that we loosely characterize as a network of bars and cables. The bars take the compressive axial load, and the cables take the tensile load. Tensegrity structures can be designed to be extremely light for a given stiffness. In our research, we focus on efficient multi-body modeling and nonlinear control of tensegrity systems. Applications considered include dexterous robotics, all-terrain ground robots, and biological systems. NSF and NASA are funding this work.</p>

<h2 id="uncertainty-quantification-in-hypersonic-flight">Uncertainty Quantification in Hypersonic Flight</h2>

<p>Hypersonic flight leading to entry descent landing of a large spacecraft on the surface of Mars has been identified as a research area by NASA. The requirement is to land within a few kilometers of the robotic test sites. One of the significant concerns of high mass entry is the mismatch between entry conditions and deceleration capabilities provided by supersonic parachute technologies. In such applications, there are uncertainties present in initial conditions and other system parameters. Estimating these systemsâ€™ parameters is a challenging problem because of the nonlinearities in the system and the lack of frequent measurements. The evolution of uncertainty (as shown in the figure) is non-Gaussian. In our work, we develop new algorithms for UQ, state-estimation, and guidance algorithms. The controlled descent ensures robustness with respect to system uncertainties and guarantees landing at the desired site with high accuracy. NASA has funded this work.</p>
