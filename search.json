    "text": "F-16 Model\nThis is a nonlinear model of the F16 aircraft. The aerodynamics included in this model come from the NASA Technical Report 1538, Simulator Study of Stall/Post-Stall Characteristics of a Fighter Airplane with Relaxed Longitudinal Static Stability, by Nguyen, Ogburn, Gilbert, Kibler, Brown, and Deal, Dec 1979. The model is based on Aircraft Control and Simulations, by Brian Stevens and Frank Lewis, Wiley Inter-Science, New York, 1992.\n\n Julia Package\n Matlab/Simulink\n\n\n\nRobust Control Toolbox\n This is a Julia implementation of robust control design and analysis algorithms. This is under development. Currently, the toolbox has support for:\n\nDefinition of linear system objects\nPlotting of standard responses\nSystem interconnections\n\nMore features are being added.\n\n\nMaximum Entropy Basis Functions\n Julia package for maximum entropy basis functions. See examples in example/ for generating basis functions and their first derivative in 1D and 2D. The code is dimension agnostic.\nThe code implements algorithm from the following paper: Local maximum-entropy approximation schemes: A seamless bridge between finite elements and meshfree methods by M. Arroyo and M. Ortiz.\n\n\nMultibody Dynamics\n Julia package for multibody dynamics using Udwadia-Kalaba formulation. This is a fairly complete package with several joint types defined. Many new features are currently being added.\n\n\nSTEDY\nSTEDY is a MATLAB Software for TEnsegrity DYnamics. In this software, the topology of the tensegrity network is described using connectivity matrices, with mass properties of the bars and cables. The dynamics is derived in the Lagrangian framework with non-minimal coordinates and holonomic constraints (paper). The software also accounts for errors in numerical integration by providing corrections for constraint violations and drifts in mechanical energy. Please see the user guide to get started.\n\n\nOPTRAGEN\n OPTRAGEN is a MATLAB toolbox for solving optimal control problems. It now works with fmincon. SNOPT dependency has been removed."
